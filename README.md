<b>Data Analysis Portfolio by Aaron Banlao</b><br>
<br>
<br>
This portfolio contains a compilation of sample assignments during my journey of learning SQL, Python (along with its various libraries), and Tableau. These assignments have been created by the instructors of the various courses I've taken. Most of the assignments were formatted in a way where pre-existing questions have been incorporated into the file, where I would then write code to derive the desired outcomes. 

<b>SQL</b>

To conclude Coursera's 'SQL for Data Science' course offered by UC Davis, this capstone project was a way to integrate the skills I've learned while solving a real world problem. My task was to analyze Yelp's dataset based off of the entity diagram. The goal was to find inferences and anomalies such as relationships between business location and overall rating. Some of the knowledge demonstrated includes: filtering, aggregate functions, joins, and more.<br>

<b>Python</b><br>
House Sales:<br>
Upon completion of IBM's Data Analysis with Python course on Coursera, this project reinforced my understanding of concepts introduced in the class. The goal was to explore a dataset containing characteristics of homes sold within King County, USA and determining which variables influence the price homes sold for. Skills that were demonstrated include: understanding the data, cleaning the data, visualizing, and model development. I've found this project to be somewhat difficult in terms of developing, testing, and training the model as I've had to refer back to my notes often.<br>

Covid-19 & Supermarket Sales:<br>
These projects were retrieved from Coursera's guided project section and has greatly familiarized myself even further with the Exploratory Data Analysis process. These projects also reflect real world problems and scenarios. As mentioned before, the tasks and questions have already been specified within the assignment in which it is up to me to evaluate the correct code. Although these projects were accompanied with a video demonstration, I've ventured to complete these projects on my own with references to documentations and stackoverflow. If by then I wasn't able to resolve any questions, I would refer back to the videos. For the most part, I've completed them on my own.
