<b>Data Analysis Portfolio by Aaron Banlao</b>

This portfolio contains a compilation of sample assignments during my journey of learning SQL, Python (along with its various libraries), and Tableau. These assignments have been created by the instructors of the various courses I've taken. Most of the assignments were formatted in a way where pre-existing questions have been incorporated into the file, where I would then write code to derive the desired outcomes.
