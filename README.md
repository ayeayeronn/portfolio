<b>Data Analysis Portfolio by Aaron Banlao</b><br>
<br>
<br>
This portfolio contains a compilation of sample assignments during my journey of learning SQL, Python (along with its various libraries), and Tableau. These assignments have been created by the instructors of the various courses I've taken. Most of the assignments were formatted in a way where pre-existing questions have been incorporated into the file, where I would then write code to derive the desired outcomes. 

<b>SQL</b>

To conclude Coursera's 'SQL for Data Science' course offered by UC Davis, this capstone project was a way to integrate the skills I've learned while solving a real world problem at the same time. My task was to analyze Yelp's dataset based off of the entity diagram. The goal was to find inferences and anomalies such as relationships between business location and overall rating. Some of the knowledge demonstrated includes: Filtering, aggregate functions, joins, and more.<br>
